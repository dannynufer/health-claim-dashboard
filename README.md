## 📚 Overview

This health insurance claim predictor was built in Python, utilizing the `pandas`, `numpy`, `statsmodels`, and `streamlit` libraries.  
It uses a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) trained on over 1,300 health claim observations to predict the size of a claim based on:

- Age
- Gender
- Smoking status
- Number of children
- Diabetic status
- Blood pressure
- BMI

The project features a clean Streamlit dashboard, allowing users to easily input different values for each explanatory variable and instantly receive a prediction.
