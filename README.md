# Health Insurance Claim Predictor
---

## Overview
This health insurance claim predictor was created in python, utilising the `pandas`, `numpy`, `statsmodels` and `streamlit` libraries. 
It uses a GLM model trained on over 1000 health claim observations to predict the size of a health claim based on: 

- Age
- Sex
- Whether they are a smoker
- Number of children
- Whether they are diabetic
- Blood pressure
- BMI

Using streamlit, I created an intuitive dashboard allowing the user to easily input different values for each explanatory variable, and instantly get an output.
